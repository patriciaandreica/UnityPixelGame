# Pixel Time

This project is a game built with Unity Game Engine and C# for the scripts. It is a 2D side scroller game, where the player moves and jumps with the arrow keys to avoid traps and enemies, and collect cherries to increase health. I made this project independently, with no previous experience of game development or how it really works, as I wanted to build something I normally wouldn't. I made this project for my COP 3003 course at FGCU. There is much room for improvement but it was awesome to see the game come to life.
