# Pixel Fun

This is a 2D game created with Unity and C# utilizing OOP skills learned from Programming II. 

## Game Description 
Pixel Fun is a side scrolller game, where you move and jump the character with the arrow keys. Once the character hits a trap 5 times, it will restart the game.
Currently, you can only collect cherries, but more features will be implemented soon.
