# Pixel Time

This project is a game built with Unity Game Engine and C# for the scripts. It is a 2D side scroller game, where the player moves and jumps with the arrow keys to avoid traps and enemies, and collect cherries to increase health. I made this project independently, with no previous experience of game development or how it really works, as I wanted to build something I normally wouldn't. I made this project for my COP 3003 course at FGCU. There is much room for improvement but it was awesome to see the game come to life.

## Documentation
As this was written in C#, I utlizied XML tags for documentation.

For the code style, I used the PascalCase naming convention and tried my best to follow the appropropriate style guide.

For Game Development with Unity in Visual Studio, it was showing up that the code analysis feature has been removed. 
I utilized ReSharper by JetBrains to inspect parts of the code and it was also useful for generating better code suggestions.
